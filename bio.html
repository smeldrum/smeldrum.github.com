		<p>My name is Spencer Meldrum and I am a currently a sophomore at Tufts University
		studying Computer Science and Music. complex music theory and appreciation can be brought to a larger 
		population through the medium of software. In my free time I like to go on hikes,
		wander the streets of Cambridge looking for bakeries, and watch my cat sass me.
		I hope you enjoy my website! </p>
